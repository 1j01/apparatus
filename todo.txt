  Thoughts on optimization
    Nested spreads seem to slow things down considerably. I'm not sure if it's all the nested try-catch statements or what. One way to avoid having try-catch to determine spread dependencies would be if cells manually declared their cell dependencies. That is, each cell would have a function for running it and a function that would return a list of cells it depends on. Then when you evaluate, you'd first evaluate the dependencies and if any of those were spreads you would spread the function in question.

Cleanup
  jsEvaluate, spread - move them into their own folder?
  Attribute - error handling throw catches everywhere.
  Build process needs cleanup since React is off on its own, vendor is hard-coded, etc.
  Can AttributeLabel and AttributeToken be merged?
  Make consistent: first get @props, then @context in views
  Clean up Model
