Root
  get stylus to convert -vendor stuff so it works in Safari, etc.
  Figure out how icons will work

Dataflow
  Test if we even need Dataflow memoization anymore...
  Thoughts on optimization
    Nested spreads seem to slow things down considerably. I'm not sure if it's all the nested try-catch statements or what. One way to avoid having try-catch to determine spread dependencies would be if cells manually declared their cell dependencies. That is, each cell would have a function for running it and a function that would return a list of cells it depends on. Then when you evaluate, you'd first evaluate the dependencies and if any of those were spreads you would spread the function in question.

Storage
  serialization (or maybe this goes in Model.Project)
  localStorage autosave
  undo/redo

Misc
  Import JSON
  Keyboard shortcuts

Model
  Project
  Element
    Add viewMatrix to "create panel" shapes
  Image Element

    Thumbnail with auto view matrix
    Select a shape to edit it

  Outline
    Reorder with drag
    Show "relevant" attributes
      has a dependency
      is depended on
      is controlled
      is a variable

  Expression
    Maybe factor a Code view
    color picker
    autocomplete
    arrow keys between them and EditableText
    drag an attribute to transclude
    click an attribute to transclude
    become multi-line if there's a \n
    disable CodeMirror undo (once Apparatus undo works)
    displaying expression values
      highlight the appropriate spread selection

  Picture
    Need to figure out all the different thumbnail needs, then refactor
    Add thumbnails everywhere

  Canvas
    Draw background grid
    Draw control points
    Pan
    Zoom
    Finish selection logic (double click)
    Controlled element

Rename
  Node.children -> childNodes
  Node.childrenOfType -> childVariantsOf

Cleanup
  jsEvaluate, spread - move them into their own folder?
  Attribute - error handling throw catches everywhere.
  Fix broken tests
  Build process needs cleanup since React is off on its own, vendor is hard-coded, etc.
  Can AttributeLabel and AttributeToken be merged?
