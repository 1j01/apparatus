Dataflow
  Test if we even need Dataflow memoization anymore...
  Thoughts on optimization
    Nested spreads seem to slow things down considerably. I'm not sure if it's all the nested try-catch statements or what. One way to avoid having try-catch to determine spread dependencies would be if cells manually declared their cell dependencies. That is, each cell would have a function for running it and a function that would return a list of cells it depends on. Then when you evaluate, you'd first evaluate the dependencies and if any of those were spreads you would spread the function in question.

Storage
  undo/redo

Misc
  Import JSON

Model
  Image Element
  Better naming/labeling system (Figure A, Rectangle 3, etc.)
  Integrate control points into e.g. Model.Shape

View
  Menubar

  Keyboard events
    cmd+z to undo
    other shortcuts based on menubar

  Create Panel
    Thumbnail with auto view matrix

  AttributeRow
    Remove a variable
    Reorder/reparent variables
    Constrain a variable within a range

  Outline
    Reorder with drag

  Expression
    color picker
    autocomplete
    arrow keys between them and EditableText
    disable CodeMirror undo (once Apparatus undo works)
    displaying expression values
      highlight the appropriate spread selection (and hover)
      click to select that particularElement

  Picture
    Need to figure out all the different thumbnail needs, then refactor
    Add thumbnails everywhere

  Canvas
    Control text on the canvas (scrubbable numbers text on canvas)
    (Multi-)Touch support

Rename
  Node.children -> childNodes
  Node.childrenOfType -> childNodesVarying

Cleanup
  Attribute - error handling throw catches everywhere.
  Build process needs cleanup since React is off on its own, vendor is hard-coded, font css is separate, etc.
  Can AttributeLabel and AttributeToken be merged?
  Make consistent: first get @props, then @context in views
  Clean up Model
  Get rid of get in get* methods
  ControlPoints needs cleanup. Smells: returning {} object, mutating it at Element and Canvas.
  Clean up relevantAttributes stuff
