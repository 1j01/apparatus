Project
  keep track of the "toolbox" (create panel) and also what is selected.
  serialize
  load serialized stuff

Storage
  localStorage autosave
  undo/redo

CSS
  get stylus to convert -vendor stuff so it works in Safari, etc.





Documentation
  summary descriptions of modules







Get Create Panel in there
Get it showing all the shapes
Thumbnail with auto view matrix
Create by dragging in
Select a shape to edit it









View

  Outline
    Reorder with drag
    Show "relevant" attributes

  Expression
    Maybe factor a Code view
    color picker
    autocomplete
    arrow keys between them and EditableText
    drag an attribute to transclude
    click an attribute to transclude
    displaying expression values



Hovering and selection
  Highlight the appropriate spread selection in attribute inspector



Test if we even need Dataflow memoization anymore...


Need to figure out all the different thumbnails, then refactor view/Picture





Add thumbnails everywhere
Add view matrix to shapes (instead of modifying the root shape)
Create panel


Rename:
  Node.children -> childNodes
  Node.childrenOfType -> childVariantsOf
  Project.viewedElement -> editingElement

Maybe move PathComponent attributes into Path element and TextComponent attributes into Text element


Needs cleanup
  jsEvaluate, spread - move them into their own folder?
  Attribute - error handling throw catches everywhere.
  Get rid of ParticularElement.ensure
